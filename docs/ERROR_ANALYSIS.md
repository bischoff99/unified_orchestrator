# Error Analysis - Upgraded Crew Test

## Critical Issue: Agents Not Using Tools

### Error Chain

1. **Builder Agent Completes Without Writing Files**
```
Agent: Senior Full-Stack Implementation Engineer
Task Status: ✅ Completed
Files Written: 0 (NONE!)
```

2. **QA Agent Tries to Read Non-Existent Files**
```
Tool: Read File
Input: "src/generated/main.py"
Output: ❌ Error reading src/generated/main.py: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

3. **src/generated/ Directory is Empty**
```bash
$ ls src/generated/
# (empty - no files created)
```

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem: Tool Avoidance Behavior

**What Happened:**
- Builder agent received task with enhanced prompts
- Agent "thought" about the task
- Agent marked task as ✅ Completed
- Agent **NEVER called write_file()** tool
- Subsequent agents failed due to missing files

**Why This Happens:**
1. CrewAI agents can complete tasks by providing textual answers
2. Tool usage is encouraged but not strictly enforced
3. Agent may interpret task as "describe what to do" rather than "do it"
4. LLM may avoid tool calling if prompt is complex/overwhelming

---

## Specific Errors Found

### Error 1: Builder Agent - No Tool Usage
```
Expected: write_file('src/generated/notes_api/main.py', code_content)
Actual: Final Answer with text description only
Result: No files created
```

### Error 2: QA Agent - File Not Found
```
Attempted: read_file('src/generated/main.py')
Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
Cause: Builder didn't create the file
```

### Error 3: QA Agent - Testing Empty Code
```
Attempted: test_code('')
Input: Empty string (no code to test)
Result: All validation checks fail
```

## Why Enhanced Prompts Didn't Work

### Our Changes:
- ✅ Added detailed code examples (60+ lines)
- ✅ Added validation checklist
- ✅ Emphasized "COMPLETE, RUNNABLE" multiple times
- ✅ Added "CRITICAL RULES" section
- ✅ Included example tool usage

### What Went Wrong:
- ❌ **Too much text** may have overwhelmed the agent
- ❌ **Examples in backstory** confused agent (thought it was reference, not template)
- ❌ **No strict enforcement** of tool usage
- ❌ **Task can be "completed"** without using tools

---

## Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Simplify and Force (Recommended)

**Drastically simplify the backstory:**
```python
backstory="""You are a senior engineer. 

CRITICAL: You MUST call write_file() to save code files.

DO THIS NOW:
1. Call: write_file('src/generated/notes_api/main.py', complete_fastapi_code)
2. Include ALL imports: Column, Integer, String, DateTime
3. Implement ALL 5 endpoints with full logic

If you don't call write_file(), you FAILED the task."""
```

**Shorter, more direct, action-focused.**

---

### Solution 2: Use Hierarchical Process with Manager

```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=list(self.agents.values()),
    tasks=self.tasks,
    process=Process.hierarchical,  # Manager enforces tool usage
    manager_llm=get_llm_backend(),
    verbose=True
)
```

The manager agent can verify tools were used and reject incomplete work.

---

### Solution 3: Make Tool Usage the Task Itself

**Change task from "Implement system" to "Call write_file() with code":**

```python
description="""Call write_file() tool to save complete FastAPI code.

Step 1: Prepare complete main.py content with ALL imports and endpoints
Step 2: Call: write_file('src/generated/notes_api/main.py', code)
Step 3: Call: write_file('src/generated/notes_api/requirements.txt', 'fastapi\nuvicorn\nsqlalchemy\npydantic')

Your task is ONLY complete when write_file() has been called."""
```

Make the tool call the primary objective, not the code quality.

---

### Solution 4: Add Post-Task Validation

```python
def validate_builder_output(output):
    """Callback to verify files were created."""
    main_file = Path("src/generated/notes_api/main.py")
    if not main_file.exists():
        raise ValueError(
            "Builder task failed: main.py was not created. "
            "Agent must call write_file() tool."
        )
    return output

build_task = Task(
    ...,
    callback=validate_builder_output
)
```

Reject task completion if files don't exist.

---

### Solution 5: Use Different Model

Try a model that's better at tool usage:
```python
# In config.py
MODEL_CONFIG = {
    "model_name": "qwen2.5-coder:7b",  # Specialized for code + tool usage
    ...
}
```

---

## Comparison: What DID Work Before

### Previous Run (Without Enhanced Prompts)
- Generated partial main.py (25 lines)
- Files WERE created (incomplete but present)
- QA could test the code
- Docs could be written

**Irony**: Simpler prompts actually got tools used, even if output was incomplete!

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Revert to Simple Prompts + Add Validation
1. Use shorter, directive backstories
2. Add callback validation to ensure files exist
3. Test again

### Option B: Try Hierarchical Process
1. Switch process to hierarchical
2. Let manager enforce tool usage
3. Test again

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
1. Keep enhanced code quality requirements
2. But drastically simplify backstory to 3-4 sentences
3. Focus on ACTION, not EXPLANATION
4. Test again

---

## Key Lesson

**More text ≠ Better results**

Simple, directive prompts with enforcement > Long detailed prompts without enforcement

---

## Impact on Quality Scores

**Before Enhancement:**
- Files Created: ✅ Yes (partial)
- Code Completeness: 10%
- Overall Score: 35/100

**After Enhancement:**
- Files Created: ❌ NO
- Code Completeness: N/A (nothing to measure)
- Overall Score: 0/100 (worse!)

**Conclusion**: Our enhancements backfired. Need to try different approach.

---

**Next Action**: Try Solution 1 (simplify + force) or Solution 2 (hierarchical process).

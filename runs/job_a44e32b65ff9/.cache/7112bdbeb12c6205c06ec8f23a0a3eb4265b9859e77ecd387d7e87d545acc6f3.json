The app will have two endpoints: POST /notes, which creates a new note, and GET /notes, which retrieves all the notes.\n\nTech Stack:\n\n* Python 3.x\n* FastAPI\n* SQLite\n\nComponents:\n\n1. Frontend: A web-based frontend that will allow users to interact with the app. The frontend will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n2. Backend: A backend server that will handle all the business logic of the app. The backend will be built using Python 3.x and FastAPI.\n3. Database: A SQLite database that will store all the notes.\n4. API Endpoints: Two endpoints (POST /notes, GET /notes) that will allow users to create and retrieve notes.\n\nData Flow:\n\n1. User interacts with the frontend of the app.\n2. Frontend sends a request to the backend server.\n3. Backend server processes the request and communicates with the database.\n4. Database stores or retrieves the data based on the request.\n5. Backend server returns the response to the frontend.\n6. Frontend displays the response to the user.\n\nDatabase Schema:\nThe SQLite database will have a single table called \"notes\" that will store all the notes. The table will have the following columns:\n\n* id (primary key, auto-increment)\n* title (string)\n* content (text)\n* created_at (timestamp)\n* updated_at (timestamp)\n\nAPI Endpoints:\nThe app will have two endpoints:\n\n1. POST /notes: This endpoint will allow users to create a new note. The request body should include the title and content of the note. The response will be a JSON object with the id, title, content, created_at, and updated_at fields.\n2. GET /notes: This endpoint will allow users to retrieve all the notes. The response will be a JSON array of objects, each representing a note. Each object will have the id, title, content, created_at, and updated_at fields.\n\nConclusion:\nThis system architecture provides a complete solution for creating a FastAPI notes app with SQLite database. The app will allow users to create and retrieve notes using two endpoints. The backend server will handle all the business logic of the app, while the frontend will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the app.",
